# Building the agent_blocks documentation SPA

## What this is
A single-page app at `/home/adamsl/agent_blocks/spa_documentation/` that documents
the `agent_blocks` repo. Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no framework — modeled
on `/home/adamsl/largo_spa` (fixed left sidebar nav, `#content` main area,
`fetch()` html partials into it).

Run it with `./start.sh` (optionally `./start.sh <port>`) from this directory,
then open `http://localhost:8931/index.html`. `start.sh` launches `server.py`,
not a bare static server, because the Update Documentation tab uses its API.

## Files
- `index.html` — shell: `.brand` label + a single `<nav id="nav">`, and `<main id="content">`.
- `app.js` — all navigation logic, the `sections` config object, and the live
  Update Documentation button/status behavior.
- `styles.css` — fixed left sidebar (170px), single nav link style, `.back` variant (red).
- `doc_source_map.py` — maps each SPA leaf path to its real source file and
  defines the six fixed leaf filenames.
- `server.py` — static server plus git-status and documentation-update routes.
- `update_documentation_agent.py` — regenerates source-derived pages for one
  mapped leaf and writes its update report.
- `home_claude_md.html` — generated from the repo's root `CLAUDE.md` via Python's
  `markdown` package. Regenerate after editing `CLAUDE.md`:
  ```bash
  python3 -c "
  import markdown
  with open('/home/adamsl/agent_blocks/CLAUDE.md') as f:
      text = f.read()
  html = markdown.markdown(text, extensions=['fenced_code', 'tables'])
  with open('home_claude_md.html', 'w') as f:
      f.write(html)
  "
  ```

## Nav is a single flat list, not stacked tiers
`#nav` is one `<nav>` element whose *contents are replaced* at each drill-down
level — it is not three nav bars stacked on top of each other. Exactly one of
these renders at a time:

1. **Home level**: `Home` (active) + one link per top-level key in `sections`.
2. **Folder level** (a top-level tab or nested group was clicked): `Home` or
   `Back` + one link per child in that node's `items`. Only those children
   show; sibling sections/groups disappear until navigating back.
3. **Item/detail level** (a leaf item was clicked): `Back` (red) + the five fixed
   detail tabs (`Source`, `Class Diagram`, `Sequence Diagram`, `Construction
   Status`, `Update Documentation`). `Back` returns to the containing folder.
4. **Construction-task level** (an opted-in Construction Status page is open):
   `Back` (red) + one link per task at the current hierarchy level. A task with
   child tasks gets the existing red Excel comment/note corner triangle via
   `.has-children`; a leaf task does not. Clicking a parent replaces the nav
   with only its direct children. `Back` moves up one task level, and from the
   task root returns to the five fixed detail tabs. The content pane shows only
   the selected task's details, never the expanded hierarchy.

When adding nav behavior, preserve this: never show two levels at once.

## Construction Status task trees

Construction Status pages may become TaskMaster-style drill-down plans without
adding per-object JavaScript. The page itself is the source of truth:

- Use one hidden root `<ol class="construction-task-tree" hidden>` and a
  preceding `<section class="construction-task-focus" hidden>` where `app.js`
  renders the selected task.
- Every task is a direct list child with `class="construction-task"`, a unique
  `data-task-id`, a concise `data-task-label` for the sidebar, and a
  `data-task-status` such as `planned`, `current`, or `done`.
- Put direct child tasks in `<ol class="construction-task-children">` inside
  their parent task. Any depth is supported.
- Do not duplicate task definitions in `app.js`. Its generic parser derives
  the current sidebar level and `.has-children` triangles from this markup.
- Keep the definition tree hidden. Navigation is responsible for expanding and
  collapsing levels; the main pane shows the landing copy or one focused task
  presentation at a time.
- A page may opt into the dynamic university-textbook task renderer by adding
  `construction-textbook-focus` to its focus section. `app.js` then derives the
  selected lesson title, purpose, status reading, scoped counts, and child/leaf
  guidance from the same hidden task markup; do not duplicate that information
  in JavaScript.
- Set `data-construction-object` on the textbook focus (and normally the hidden
  tree) so generated lesson editions and footers name the owning Agent Block.
  The shared textbook presentation lives in `styles.css`; new object plans do
  not need to duplicate those style rules inside each HTML fragment.
- Landing pages may expose live totals with `data-construction-count`,
  `data-construction-completion`, and `data-construction-progress`. The generic
  renderer calculates them from task statuses whenever Construction Status
  opens. The full hierarchy must remain hidden even when these summaries are
  visible.
- Pages without `.construction-task-tree` retain the ordinary five-tab behavior.

Treat the task hierarchy as a SOLID decomposition, not indentation for its own
sake. A red-triangle branch is one cohesive workstream. An untagged leaf is one
small outcome that can be implemented and verified independently. Split a leaf
again when it still contains multiple responsibilities, multiple unrelated
kinds of evidence, or work owned by different Agent Blocks. Do not place UI
state mutation under an agent transport interface merely because both appear in
the same end-to-end sequence.

Use `voice_communication/conversation_agent/basic_agent_construction_status.html`
as the working reference.

## Directory layout mirrors `sections` in app.js
Each section key in `app.js`'s `sections` object is expected to have a same-named
folder here (e.g. `catherine_agent_sdk/`). Nested `items` maps mirror nested
folders; leaf items hold these exact six files (see
`catherine_agent_sdk/basic_agent/` for the reference set):

```
basic_agent.html                       # overview, loads when the item tab is clicked
basic_agent.py.html                    # "Source" detail tab
basic_agent_construction_status.html   # "Construction Status" detail tab
mermaid_class.html                     # "Class Diagram" detail tab
mermaid_sequence.html                  # "Sequence Diagram" detail tab
basic_agent_update_documentation.html  # report body for "Update Documentation"
```

Yes — the basenames are literally `basic_agent*` even inside `future_agent/`.
That's intentional per the current skeleton; `app.js` hardcodes these filenames
as constants (`overviewFile`, `detailTabs`) rather than deriving them from the
item key. If a new item ever needs different basenames, that's a deliberate
decision to revisit `app.js`, not an oversight.

## Adding a new section or item
1. Add the key to `sections` in `app.js` (label + `items: {}` or item map).
2. Create the matching folder(s) under `spa_documentation/`, each leaf with the six
   files above (can be empty — see below).
3. Add or update its source mapping in `doc_source_map.py`; without a resolvable
   mapping, git status and Update Documentation cannot work.
4. No other nav wiring is needed; navigation renders from `sections`.

Folder nodes may have an optional `_overview.html` alongside their child
folders. `showCurrentContent()` loads it as the folder cover page and executes
any embedded scripts, so a polished overview can include the same interactive
Mermaid pattern as detail pages.

## Blank files are expected, not bugs
Skeleton files are created empty and filled in later. `loadFile()` in `app.js`
already handles this: an empty file renders a `.placeholder` "still blank"
message instead of a blank white page, and a 404 renders a "not built yet"
message. When filling in a page for real, just write real HTML into the file —
no wrapper markup required, `loadFile()` injects it as-is into `#content`.

## Style notes
- Match `largo_spa`'s visual language: dark sidebar (`#333`)/link pills
  (`#4c6ef5`), not new colors per nav tier — we deliberately moved away from a
  three-color tiered look back to one nav style plus the red `.back` link.
- Keep `main` centered with the `calc(170px + 40px)` left margin so it lines up
  with the fixed sidebar width; if the sidebar width changes, update both the
  `header` width and this margin together.

## Source tab: syntax highlighting and header line
`basic_agent.py.html` is the fixed legacy filename for the Source tab; the real
mapped source may be Python or TypeScript. It holds source pre-rendered as VS
Code Dark+-colored HTML, not raw `<pre>` text — there's no highlighter wired
into the SPA at runtime, so generate it ahead of time with the language-correct
Pygments lexer and a custom style class mapping VS Code Dark+ token colors,
then paste the output in.
See `catherine_agent_sdk/basic_agent/basic_agent.py.html` for the reference:
a `<style>` block scoped to `.vscode-pre` + Pygments' `.get_style_defs()`
output, then `<pre class="vscode-pre"><code>...</code></pre>` with the
highlighted body. Bare `http*` URLs that show up inside a `# comment` in the
source should become real `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`
links, colored `inherit` from the comment span (`.vscode-pre .c1 a { color:
inherit; text-decoration: underline; }`) so the link doesn't stick out from
the surrounding comment color — only the underline marks it clickable.

Below the `<h1>Source</h1>` heading, add a one-line subtitle using the
existing `.placeholder` class (already defined in `styles.css` — gray,
italic, no new CSS needed):
```html
<p class="placeholder">Lines: 80&nbsp;&nbsp;Last modified: August, 28 08:19:55</p>
```
`Lines` is the source file's line count (`wc -l`), `Last modified` is its
mtime (`stat -c '%y'`), formatted as `Month, day HH:MM:SS`. This is
generated once and pasted in as static text, same as the highlighted body —
regenerate both if the mapped source file changes.

## Update Documentation tab and source status

The fifth detail tab loads `basic_agent_update_documentation.html`, then `app.js`
fetches relative `api/git-status?item=...` once for the open detail page. Keep
that URL relative: the SPA also runs behind `/agent-block/` in the main Letta
dashboard, where `/api/...` would target the wrong server.

`doc_source_map.py` is the source of truth for leaf-to-source mappings. Its
`DOC_FILES` includes all six page names; `SOURCE_DERIVED_DOCS` currently marks
Source, Class Diagram, and Sequence Diagram as generated evidence. A leaf is
dirty when its mapped source is Git-dirty or any source-derived page is missing
or empty. The Update button then starts `update_documentation_agent.py` through
`server.py` and displays the generated report in the sixth file.

The updater began as a Python-source workflow. When adding TypeScript-backed
objects, ensure generated source uses a TypeScript lexer and language-appropriate
diagram content; the `.py.html` filename does not make the source Python.

## Mermaid diagrams (Class/Sequence tabs) need JS execution + vendoring
`mermaid_class.html` and `mermaid_sequence.html` are not static markup —
they embed a `<script>` that renders a mermaid diagram into an interactive,
pannable/zoomable SVG. Three things have to be true for this to work in this
SPA, all already wired up as of this skill's last update:

1. **`app.js`'s `loadFile()` executes `<script>` tags.** Setting
   `content.innerHTML` does *not* run embedded scripts — the browser ignores
   them. `loadFile()` calls `executeScripts( content )` after every
   `innerHTML` assignment, which clones each `<script>` node so it actually
   runs. Don't remove this; every interactive detail page depends on it.
2. **Mermaid is vendored locally, not pulled from a CDN**, at
   `spa_documentation/vendor/mermaid.min.js` (currently v10.9.8, copied from
   an npm cache — there is no package manifest in this repo, so re-vendoring
   means finding another local copy or downloading one by hand). Diagram
   pages lazy-load it with a small `ensureMermaidLoaded()` helper that checks
   `window.mermaid` first (so navigating between diagram tabs doesn't
   re-fetch it) and otherwise appends `<script src="vendor/mermaid.min.js">`
   to `<head>` — **relative, not `/vendor/mermaid.min.js`**. This page can be
   reverse-proxied under a subpath (e.g. `/agent-block/` in the letta-code
   dashboard); a leading slash resolves against the *proxy's* domain root
   and 404s there, same failure mode as the `/api/git-status` fetch in
   app.js. The document is always loaded at the server's own root regardless
   of how deep the current item's nav path is, so a plain relative path is
   always correct here.
3. **The host document must declare `<meta charset="utf-8">`.** `index.html`
   already does. This matters because mermaid's minified bundle contains
   multibyte UTF-8 characters; without an explicit charset on the *document*
   that's loading the `<script src>`, the browser can guess the wrong
   encoding for the external script and throw `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid
   or unexpected token` on load. This only bites pages loaded directly
   (e.g. testing a diagram `.html` file standalone) — going through
   `index.html`'s nav is always safe. If you ever test a diagram fragment in
   isolation, wrap it in a full HTML doc with `<meta charset="utf-8">` first.

### The pan/zoom pattern (mermaid.live-style)
Each diagram page is self-contained (own `<style>` and `<script>`, no shared
JS file) and follows this structure — copy
`catherine_agent_sdk/basic_agent/mermaid_sequence.html` as the reference
rather than re-deriving it:

- `.mmd-wrap` > `.mmd-toolbar` (zoom in/out/reset buttons + a hint label) and
  `#mmd-viewport` (`.mmd-viewport`, fixed height, `overflow: hidden`, dotted
  grid background) > `#mmd-stage` (`.mmd-stage`, `position: absolute`,
  `transform-origin: 0 0`) > `<pre class="mermaid" id="mmd-source">` holding
  the raw diagram definition text.
- Do not add `will-change: transform` to `.mmd-stage`. Keeping the SVG in a
  persistent compositor layer can rasterize it and make Mermaid text blurry;
  the normal `transform` updates already provide the required pan and zoom.
- `ensureMermaidLoaded()` → `mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false })` →
  `mermaid.render()` the source text → `stage.innerHTML = svg` → then wire up
  pan/zoom on the rendered stage.
- Zoom is mouse-wheel, zooming toward the cursor position (not the center) —
  `wheel` listener with `preventDefault()`, scale clamped `[0.2, 4]`. Pan is
  pointer-drag using `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup` with
  `setPointerCapture`, scoped to `#mmd-viewport` only (not `window`) so
  listeners never leak across nav re-renders — each nav change replaces
  `#content`, which garbage-collects the old viewport and its listeners.
  Toolbar buttons zoom toward the viewport center.
- Give each `mermaid.render()` call a unique id (e.g. `"mmd-svg-" +
  Date.now()`) — reusing one across nav visits/re-renders can collide.

### Verifying a diagram page actually works
`loadFile()`'s script execution and mermaid's rendering are both invisible
to a plain `curl`/`Read` check — you have to actually run JS. Headless
Chrome is available (`google-chrome --headless --disable-gpu`) and works
well for this: serve the SPA (`./start.sh`), then either
`--dump-dom` a test harness page that calls `selectSection()` /
`selectItem()` / `selectDetail()` from `app.js` directly and logs
`document.querySelectorAll("#content svg").length`, or check
`google-chrome`'s stderr (`--enable-logging=stderr --v=1`) for `CONSOLE`
lines to catch JS errors. Don't `--virtual-time-budget` a *standalone*
diagram fragment and conclude it's broken from a `SyntaxError` there — see
the charset note above; test through `index.html`'s real nav flow instead.
